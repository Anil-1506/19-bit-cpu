# 19-bit-cpu
a 19 bit cpu This project implements a custom 19-bit CPU using Verilog HDL.
It supports a basic instruction set with modules for ALU, Control Unit, Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Data Memory, and Register File.
Simulation is performed using Icarus Verilog (iverilog), and waveforms are analyzed with GTKWave / Waveform Viewer Extension in GitHub Codespaces
